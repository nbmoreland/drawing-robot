# LEGO SPIKE Prime Stair-Climbing Robot

A Python-based autonomous stair-climbing robot built with LEGO SPIKE Prime and programmed using the Pybricks library. The robot uses color detection to identify stairs and automatically adjusts its climbing behavior based on progress.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent stair-climbing robot that can:
- Detect stairs using a color sensor (black surfaces indicate stairs)
- Autonomously climb multiple stairs with adaptive speed control
- Track progress through stair counting
- Gracefully transition between climbing phases
- Stop automatically after completing the climbing sequence

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

### LEGO Components
- **LEGO SPIKE Prime Hub** (or compatible LEGO Education hub)
- **3x LEGO Motors**:
  - Left drive motor
  - Right drive motor  
  - Rear auxiliary motor (for additional climbing support)
- **1x Color Sensor** for stair detection
- LEGO Technic parts for robot chassis construction

### Port Configuration
| Component | Port | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Left Motor | A | Drive motor for left side |
| Right Motor | F | Drive motor for right side (counter-clockwise) |
| Rear Motor | B | Auxiliary motor for climbing assistance |
| Color Sensor | C | Detects black surfaces (stairs) |

## üì¶ Software Requirements

- **Pybricks firmware** installed on your SPIKE Prime hub
  - Download from [pybricks.com](https://pybricks.com/)
  - Follow the [installation guide](https://pybricks.com/install/)
- **Python 3.x** (comes with Pybricks)
- **Pybricks library** (pre-installed with Pybricks firmware)

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

1. **Install Pybricks Firmware**
   ```bash
   # Visit https://pybricks.com/install/
   # Follow instructions for your operating system
   ```

2. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drawing-robot.git
   cd drawing-robot
   ```

3. **Connect your SPIKE Prime hub**
   - Turn on the hub
   - Connect via USB or Bluetooth
   - Use Pybricks Code or VS Code with Pybricks extension

4. **Upload the code**
   - Open the project in your Pybricks environment
   - Upload `main.py` and `robot.py` to the hub

## ü§ñ How It Works

### Architecture

The robot uses a state machine architecture with two main components:

1. **`main.py`** - Entry point that initializes the robot and runs the main control loop
2. **`robot.py`** - Contains the `Robot` class with all hardware interfaces and behavior logic

### State Machine

The robot operates in two states:

- **`climbing`** - Active climbing mode with three phases:
  - Phase 1 (0-2 stairs): Fast climbing at full speed
  - Phase 2 (3-4 stairs): Pause/transition phase
  - Phase 3 (5+ stairs): Slow, careful climbing
- **`done`** - Terminal state when climbing is complete

### Climbing Algorithm

```python
1. Initialize robot with all motors and sensors
2. Start in "climbing" state
3. While not done:
   a. Read color sensor
   b. If black detected ‚Üí increment stair counter
   c. Adjust speed based on stair count:
      - < 3 stairs: Speed 500, rear motor 500
      - 3-4 stairs: Stop (transition phase)
      - > 4 stairs: Speed 50, rear motor 5
   d. Check if complete (>5 stairs) ‚Üí transition to "done"
4. Stop all motors
```

### DriveBase Configuration
- **Wheel diameter**: 56mm
- **Axle track**: 114mm (distance between wheels)
- These values are crucial for accurate movement calculations

## üíª Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **Position the robot** at the base of the stairs
2. **Run the program**:
   ```python
   python main.py
   ```
3. The robot will automatically:
   - Start climbing when it detects black surfaces
   - Adjust speed based on progress
   - Stop after climbing 5+ stairs

### Console Output

The robot provides real-time feedback:
```
Color.BLACK
1
Color.BLACK
2
...
```

## üé® Customization

### Adjusting Climbing Behavior

Modify thresholds in `robot.py`:

```python
# Change completion threshold (default: 5 stairs)
if self.stair_count > 5:  # Adjust this value
    self.current_state = "done"

# Modify speed phases
if self.stair_count < 3:  # Phase 1 threshold
    self.drive_base.drive(500, 0)  # Adjust speed
elif self.stair_count >= 3 and self.stair_count < 4:  # Phase 2
    self.drive_base.drive(0, 0)  # Pause phase
else:  # Phase 3
    self.drive_base.drive(50, 0)  # Slow speed
```

### Color Detection

Change the target color for stair detection:
```python
if color == Color.BLACK:  # Change to Color.RED, Color.BLUE, etc.
    self.stair_count = self.stair_count + 1
```

### Motor Configuration

Adjust motor ports or directions:
```python
self.left_motor = Motor(Port.A)  # Change port
self.right_motor = Motor(Port.F, Direction.COUNTERCLOCKWISE)  # Change direction
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Robot doesn't move | Check motor connections and battery level |
| Color sensor not detecting | Ensure sensor is close to surface (~1cm) |
| Robot turns instead of going straight | Calibrate wheel diameter and axle track values |
| Motors running in wrong direction | Add `Direction.COUNTERCLOCKWISE` parameter |
| Program won't upload | Ensure Pybricks firmware is installed |

### Debug Mode

Add verbose logging by modifying `robot.py`:
```python
def move(self):
    color = self.color_sensor.color()
    print(f"Color: {color}, Stair count: {self.stair_count}, State: {self.current_state}")
    # ... rest of code
```
